// Q. 로그가 뭐야 ???
// A. 로그 함수는 지수 함수의 반대이다. ex) log₂(8) = 3 ---> 2³ = 8

// Logarithmic time complexity is great!

// for what ? : Certain searching algorithms / efficient sorting algorithms / recursion


/** 🌟 Recap
 * 1. To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation.
 * 2. Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
 * 3. Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
 * 4. The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardward used to run the algorithm.
 * 5. Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!
