// 1. Understand the problem
// 2. Explore Concrete Examples
// 3. Break it down
// 4. Solve / Simplify
// 5. Look back and refactor


/** 🌟 Understand the problem : 문제를 이해하기
 * 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words ?
 * 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
 * --> 숫자면? 정수 or 소수? 아주 큰 숫자라면? 
 * 3. What arte the outputs that should come from the solutin to the problem?
 * 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (in other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?)
 * 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem ?
 * --> 무엇이 중요한가?
